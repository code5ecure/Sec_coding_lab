## üîê Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide a structured and practical resource for software developers and security engineers to:

- Understand common web security issues (e.g., injection, authentication flaws, insecure deserialization).
- Analyze insecure .NET codebases and fix vulnerabilities.
- Learn to use Identity Framework and ASP.NET Core securely.
- Practice secure design and implementation patterns using C# and .NET Core APIs.
